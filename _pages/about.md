I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student of [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), majoring in computer science and technology. I'm from Sichuan, China, a province famous for delicious food and place of interest.

My research interest lies in software engineering and data analysis, and recently I'm doing research on mechanism of good first issue.

In my spare time, I like drawing pictures, listening to music and playing pipa, a kind of Chinese traditional musical instrument.
